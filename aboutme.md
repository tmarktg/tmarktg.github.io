### My story

Hey, Iâ€™m Mark ðŸ‘‹

Not sure how you landed here, maybe I tricked you into clicking a link (sorry, not sorry). Either way, welcome.

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who loves building things and watching them evolve, whether itâ€™s a clean product from scratch, a script that boosts traffic, or even a half-finished project I shamelessly copied off the internet. If itâ€™s working, teaching me something, or making someoneâ€™s life easier, Iâ€™m all in.

What keeps me going? The idea that everything is an opportunity to learn something a mentor once told me that really stuck. That mindset helps me push through the tough stuff: reading dense docs, debugging for hours, or rewriting something five times until it finally clicks. That process? Itâ€™s the same one that built the tools we all use today like ChatGPT quietly running the world behind the scenes.

But hey, enough tech talk.

Iâ€™m a big fan of cheeseburgers, pizza, and anything with too much cheese (even though Iâ€™m lactose intolerant â€” tragic, I know). I like long walks, time in nature, and taking on challenges that are slightly above my skill level â€” because thatâ€™s where the good growth happens.

Thanks for stopping by. If my development journey feels a little too relatable or sent you down a rabbit hole, then yes, Iâ€™ve successfully sabotaged you.
